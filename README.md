### Functionality

This is the [Micro-Reddit](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails) project, which creates an extremely simplified Reddit-like backend in order to practice using Active Record.

### Thoughts

After reading so much about Active Record, I wasn't entirely sure that all of it stuck - but once I managed to try it out, this project actually went very smoothly. I'm grateful to be able to use Active Record rather than having to do all of this in SQL. The project's warm-up, which presented a similar (though more complex) scenario and asked me to just map out the models, columns, validations, and associations, was also very helpful. Approaching this project the same way, with a strategic and pre-planned approach to the database, made it very simple. Then it was simply a matter of learning and practicing the execution, which was quite intuitive.

God bless.
